- 👋 Hi, I’m @jessepope
- 👀 I’m interested in merging social justice and technology to create a different future for all of us.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack software development at Ada Developers Academy and interning at a tech company.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! My favorite part about code is the opportunity to learn every day.
